# Genshin Impact Planner

In progress. Personal project.

Credits to :
- [theBowja](https://github.com/theBowja) for the API / Database. Their work helped me figure out how to get the specific images I wanted from the wiki.
- [Primajin](https://github.com/Primajin) for the code filtering the materials in different categories and for the "Click to up the count, input with text how much you need" idea (not implemented yet on my project).
- [angelbubsie](https://angelbubsie.notion.site/Notion-Templates-Resources-31edc6a7feb6465596b14d5745959c99) for the inspiration, wihtout this template I would not have known where to begin. I'm focusing on making the "Planner" page as it can't be updated automatically.
- [The Genshin Impact Wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki) from where I planned to take my pictures.
